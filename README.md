# CS303-Assignment-1
I tried my best
When you run the program it will prompt you to enter the integer that you want to find in the array. The user will then input a number from 1-100 and if the number is out of those bounds an error message will appear. Then it will ask the user to input the index in the array that they want to delete from the array. The user will input whatever number between 1-100 they want and it will output the array with the index they chose deleted.
PS I could only figure out half the requirements.
